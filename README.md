## Directory and Files:
- `.vscode` contains my vs code configuration. You might want to use your own.
- `release` contains all the dlls and main.exe required to run the program on a windows machine.
  - Under this folder we have `main.exe`. Double click on this and run the game.
  - All other are required dll files necessary to run the game and must be present in the same folder.
- `src` folder contains the active working directory.
  - `custom_headers` contain the custom header files made for the project.
  - `exec` contains the most recent executable along with dll and ilk and other stuff generated by the compiler.
  - `obj` contains the intermediate object files that are generated by the compiler.
  - `main.cpp` contains the main run code.
  - `onion.py` is a small python script I wrote to automate my repetitive tasks. Following are the commands which can be run from cmd from the project root dir.
    - `python onion.py make debug` : Compiles the code and puts the executable into `exec` and object files into `obj` folder
    - `python onion.py make release` : Copies the recently compiled executable from exec into release folder. If executable does not exist then run the debug build then copies. 
    - `python onion.py run debug` : Runs the executable in the debug folder.
    - `python onion.py run release` : Runs the executable in the release folder.
    - `python onion.py pack debug` : Packs the src folder into a zip. 
    - `python onion.py pack release` : Packs the release folder into a zip. 
  - `release_pack.zip` is zipped version of release folder.
  - `src_pack.zip` is zipped version of src folder.

## Setup:
  - Install the SFML library and edit the library path in the `.vscode` folder and in the `onion.py` script also.
  - Install Visual Studio and C/C++ tools along with it.
  - Install the C/C++ extension from Microsoft in VS Code.
  - Run `Developer Command Prompt for the Visual Studio` for the `32-bit architecture`.
  - Change the directory to the project directory.
  - Run `code .` command.
  - Now you are ready to work with the project.

## Run Only:
To simply run the game just donwload the release pack, extract it and run the main.exe
